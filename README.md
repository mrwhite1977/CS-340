How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The goal of good code is to use an object-oriented approach. This allows you to create modularized code that can be adapted and modified throughout a program to accomplish similar tasks. This speeds up the development process. The CRUD components for this project are a great example of this. To effectively use a database, you need to interact with data by creating, reading, updating, and deleting information. Developing simple yet powerful commands allows the user to interact with all data within the app even when new data is added and expanded. The CRUD

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
